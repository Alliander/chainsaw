= Chainsaw

[quote]
A versatile tool for logging in manageable pieces.

Chainsaw is a Clojure library for logging datastructures with `taoensso/timbre`. It also comes with an Elastiscsearch appender to improve the usability of your data driven logging.

== Inspiration
This library was inspired by the Juxt blogpost link:https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/logging.html[Logging: change your mind] from 2016. It outlines the reasons for data driven logging, and how one could go about adopting it. Chainsaw was conceived as a implementation for this concept.

== Examples

.Add the library
[source, clojure]
----
[com.alliander.chainsaw/core "0.1.0"]
----

.Require libraries
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[com.alliander.chainsaw.core :as logd]
         '[taoensso.timbre :as log])
----

.Simple data-driven logging
[source, clojure]
----
(logd/errord ::http-request.failed {:request request :response response})
----

.Incrementally appending logging context
[source, clojure]
----
(let [user-id (:user-id request)]

  ;; log the user-id from now on, conventional timbre style
  (logd/with-merged-context {:user-id user-id}

    (logd/infod ::service.called)

    (if-let [service-level (service-level user-id)]

      ;; add the service level to the logging context
      (do (log/with-context {:service-level service-level}
            (logd/info ::service-level.found))
          (service service-level)

      ;; feature-rich logging
      (do (logd/error ::service-level.not-found {:request request})
          (reject))))))
----

.Dealing with exceptions
[source, clojure]
----
;; We pass exceptions as the first argument
(logd/error e ::exception)
